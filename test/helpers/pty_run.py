"""A real pseudo-terminal harness for the CLI's TTY-only code paths.

Piping a child process's output through an ordinary subprocess pipe can
never make `process.stdout.isTTY` true in that child — a pipe is not a
terminal, no matter how it's wired up. That makes the staggered TTY checkup,
the closing score-card ordering, and the share prompt permanently
unreachable from a plain subprocess spawn: those branches only run when
stdout genuinely is a terminal.

A pseudo-terminal (pty) is the only way to make that true from a test. This
harness forks the target command onto the slave end of a real pty, so the
child inherits a genuine TTY on fd 0/1/2; watches the growing transcript for
known interactive-prompt tails and types a canned reply the instant one
appears, so the child never blocks waiting on a human; and reports the full
captured transcript plus exit status as one JSON line on ITS OWN stdout — a
plain pipe back to the caller (only the CHILD sees the pty).

python3's standard library ships everything this needs (pty, fcntl, termios,
select) with no extra install step, and this repository already treats
python3 as a soft dependency: tests that need it skip cleanly, rather than
failing, when it — or a working pty — isn't available on the machine running
them.

Usage:
    python3 pty_run.py <timeout_seconds> <cmd> [args...]

The environment is inherited as-is from whatever spawned this process (the
caller sets it up before spawning); this script never touches it.

Output contract — one line, on this process's own stdout, printed once at
the very end:
    {"exit": <int|null>, "timedOut": <bool>, "output": "<full utf-8 capture>"}
`exit` is the child's real exit code, a negative signal number if a signal
killed it, or null if the hard deadline fired first (in which case the child
is SIGKILLed rather than left to run past its budget).
