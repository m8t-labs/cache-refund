**Finds the money your Claude Code cache is leaking.**

## How to run

```bash
npx cache-refund
```

No install, no account, no config. Node 18+. (The installed command, once you
do install it, is plain `cache-refund`.) Prefer it conversational? It also
ships as a Claude Code plugin — see [Use it inside Claude Code](#use-it-inside-claude-code).

> **100% local.** Reads token counts and timestamps only. No conversation content. No network.

Zero runtime dependencies, too — the entire tool is one `tsc`-compiled TypeScript
CLI, nothing to audit but the code itself.

- **API-billed, still on the 5-minute default?** The recommender: "you left ~$X
  on the table over the last 90 days — one line recovers it. Claim your cache
  refund? [y/N]"
- **API-billed, already on the 1-hour TTL?** The validator: confirms 1h is still
  winning, or tells you to revert if your pattern shifted back toward 5m.
- **On a subscription?** The receipt: what your (already-automatic) 1h cache
  saved you, plus a leak table for what's still eating your quota.

Below the break-even on any branch, you get **"Certified optimal"** instead of a
nag — that's also a screenshot worth sharing.

## How it works

Every cache-write is a token you paid a **markup** to store (1.25× base input on
the 5-minute TTL, 2× on the 1-hour TTL). `cache-refund` buckets each write by the
gap since the previous turn in that session. Then it prices a **symmetric
counterfactual** — what a fully-5m world and a fully-1h world would each have
billed on *your* tokens — so the verdict is a threshold you cross, not a guess.

| gap since previous turn | bucket | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| session start, or > 60 min | **cold** | unavoidable — a fresh cache had to be written. Informational. |
| 5–60 min | **recoverable** | the leak. A 1-hour TTL would still have this cached; a 5-minute TTL made you pay to write it again. |
| ≤ 5 min | **warm** | cheap re-use — cached under either TTL. |

The one number that decides the recommendation is **R/C** — the share of your
cache-write tokens that fell in the recoverable bucket. Above **39.5%**, the
1-hour TTL is cheaper for your pattern; below it, the 5-minute default already
wins. Not a vibe — it's `(2 − 1.25) / (2 − 0.1)`, derived in
[METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md).

Run `npx cache-refund --explain` to see every formula with *your*
numbers substituted in.

## The fix, and how to trust it

For an API user whom the math tells to switch:

```bash
npx cache-refund enable     # adds ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1 to ~/.claude/settings.json
```

This is the **only** thing `cache-refund` ever writes, it asks first (unless you
pass `--yes`), it backs up `settings.json` before touching it, and it preserves
every other key. `npx cache-refund revert` undoes it.

The env flag only applies to **sessions started after the change**, and Claude
Code has had intermittent flakiness landing it
([anthropics/claude-code#49139](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/49139)),
so the tool verifies itself rather than asking you to trust it:

```bash
npx cache-refund verify     # after a few turns in a fresh session
```

`verify` re-reads your *newest* transcripts and checks the **TTL reality check**
— the TTL you are *actually receiving* per your last few days of usage, read
straight from the `ephemeral_5m`/`ephemeral_1h` usage fields, not from what
`settings.json` claims. If 1h landed, it says so. Later:

```bash
npx cache-refund recheck    # the comeback loop
```

`recheck` compares against a small baseline saved at enable time and shows
"since switching: $X saved". No external tools at any step — the product
verifies the product.

## Why the TTL reality check exists (a cautionary tale)

In March 2026 the Claude API server-side **silently downgraded** some 1-hour
cache writes to 5-minute for a stretch — settings said 1h, transcripts billed
5m. Anyone reasoning from their *config* rather than their *transcripts* was
quietly wrong for weeks.

The sharpest illustration we know of: a public community backtest once modeled
cache-keepalive strategies against an *assumed* TTL. When the models were
finally checked against real billed tokens, **six carefully-modeled strategies
all lost to a one-line heuristic** — and part of the modeling had rested on a
TTL that the server wasn't actually honoring. The lesson `cache-refund`
takes from that story: **measure the TTL you received, don't trust the one you set.**
That is why every checkup leads with the reality-check line, and why the
regression *watchdog* (below) is the roadmap's flagship.

## Use it inside Claude Code

`cache-refund` also ships as a Claude Code plugin, so you can run the checkup
conversationally instead of from a terminal:

```
/plugin marketplace add cache-refund/cache-refund
```

Then just ask — "am I leaking money on cache?" or "run cache-refund" — and the
agent runs the analyzer, narrates the number, the gap breakdown, and the
verdict in plain language. It never edits `settings.json` on your behalf: it
only ever surfaces the `enable`/`revert` command and asks you to run it — the
tool's own confirmation prompt is the only write path, same as the CLI.

## FAQ

**I'm on a subscription (Pro/Max) — is there anything to do?**
No action, but there is a receipt. Subscribers already get the 1-hour TTL
automatically; `cache-refund` shows you what it saved you and where your quota is
still leaking (model switches, cold starts). Dollar figures are labeled
`$-equivalent (API list rates)` because the subscription quota formula is
undisclosed — we price your tokens at API list rates so the number is *anchored
and reproducible*, but it is not a bill. The `--plan <usd>` flag turns the
receipt into a multiple of your subscription price.

**Does it work on Bedrock / Vertex?**
Yes. `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` is an API/Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry feature, so the
enable recommendation applies to all of them. The analyzer reads the same
transcript format regardless of provider.

**Does it work with Codex / OpenAI?**
There's nothing for `cache-refund` to advise there. OpenAI's prompt caching is
automatic — writes cost nothing extra, cached reads are discounted, and
retention tiers are priced identically — so there's no 5m-vs-1h decision to
make. A cache-health view for other CLIs is on the roadmap.

**Is the efficiency score comparable between people?**
Only within a `score_version`. This is `score_version: 1` (printed in `--json`
and in [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md)). The formula is fully documented; if
it ever changes, the version bumps, so a v1 score is only ever compared to
another v1 score.

**A leak row says $0.00 — is that a bug?**
Almost certainly not. Subagent-5m overhead is $0 if you ran no sidechains in the
window; compaction rewrites are near-$0 if you rarely `/compact`; and the
recoverable-leak dollars are *net* of what a 1h TTL would itself cost, so a row
can legitimately be $0 when the tail write cancels the saving. Zero rows are
honest, not missing data.

**Does sharing phone home?**
No. The CLI itself makes zero network requests, sharing included. The optional
share prompt (interactive terminal runs only) opens *your own browser* with a
prefilled post — text you read, and can edit or abandon, before anything is
sent — or copies the markdown block (or the generated card image) to your
local clipboard. Nothing is transmitted by `cache-refund`, ever. The prompt
appears at the end of every interactive run; Enter skips it, and `--no-share`
(or env `CACHE_REFUND_NO_SHARE=1`) silences it entirely, every time.

**I think a number is wrong.**
That is the highest-priority kind of bug report. Open a
[wrong-number issue](https://github.com/cache-refund/cache-refund/issues/new?template=wrong-number.yml)
— it asks for your `--json` and `--explain` output (token counts and timestamps
only, no content) so the exact figure can be reproduced and traced through the
formula.

## Roadmap

- **v1.1 — the TTL regression watchdog.** A `watch` mode that alarms the moment
  your received TTL flips (the March-2026 incident, turned into a live tripwire).
  Plus `card --html` (a self-contained dark-mode card for LinkedIn/decks) and
  sleep-window learning to split cold gaps into "asleep" vs "abandoned".
  `watch` is teased in the checkup footer as *coming* — it is not a shipped
  command yet.
- **v1.5 — `team`** aggregate mode (v1 already ships `--json` + a documented `jq`
  merge for fleets).
- **v2 — a policy simulator** behind the same cost model: price
  `5m+keepalive` and `1h+keepalive` for API users.

The roadmap has one rule (see [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md) and
[GOOD-SETTINGS.md](./GOOD-SETTINGS.md)): every new check must be *computed from
your transcripts, priced, and paired with one concrete fix.* Generic
settings-opinion tips are never product.

## Relationship to spend dashboards

Spend dashboards report what you **spent**. `cache-refund` reports what you
**wasted, why, and the fix** — it is the decision, not the dashboard. They
compose: watch your spend wherever you already watch it, then run `cache-refund`
when you want to know whether the cache defaults are costing you and what to
change. (The per-TTL write pricing here comes from Anthropic's published
per-model rates, re-derived in [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md) with the
retrieval date cited in `src/pricing.ts`.)
