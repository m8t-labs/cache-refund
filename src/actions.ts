/**
 * Actions API — the ONLY write path in cache-refund.
 *
 * "100% local, read-only except one confirmed line" is enforced entirely by
 * this module. Treat every function here like a migration script:
 * read -> validate -> backup -> targeted edit -> report. Never a blind
 * overwrite.
 *
 * Public API:
 *
 *   applyEnable(opts: ActionOpts): ActionResult
 *   applyRevert(opts: ActionOpts): ActionResult
 *   runVerify(opts: ActionOpts): Promise<ActionResult>
 *   runRecheck(opts: ActionOpts): Promise<ActionResult>
 *
 * `home` is REQUIRED (not defaulted to os.homedir() in here) on purpose: the
 * highest-blast-radius code in the repo should make it structurally
 * impossible to accidentally touch a real home from a code path that forgot
 * to think about it. Callers (cli.ts, tests) must always be explicit.
 *
 * `--json` mode never reaches these functions at all — cli.ts's dispatch()
 * returns before the subcommand switch whenever args.json is true (see
 * cli.ts's "`--json` always wins" comment), so the never-writes law for
 * `--json` is enforced structurally at the call site, not by a flag in here.
