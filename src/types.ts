/**
 * Core data contracts for cache-refund.
 *
 * This file freezes two stable interfaces:
 *   {@link TurnEvent} — the parse output, produced by parse.ts and consumed
 *     by the renderer and the actions module.
 *   {@link Summary} — the `--json` schema, produced by parse.ts/analyze.ts
 *     and consumed by the renderer (render.ts), the actions module
 *     (baseline/recheck), and the documentation (METHODOLOGY.md).
 *
 * Both are intentionally self-describing: every derived number carries its
 * inputs or units so downstream renderers never have to re-derive.

/**

 * Field provenance (from the live JSONL, probed on the real corpus):
 *   ts       — top-level `timestamp` (ISO-8601), as epoch seconds (float).
 *   model    — `message.model` (e.g. "claude-opus-4-8"; may be a
 *              Bedrock/Vertex-prefixed id like "us.anthropic.claude-…" or
 *              the special "<synthetic>" no-charge model).
 *   sessionKey — file basename + ":" + `sessionId` (matches the oracle key).
 *   isSidechain — top-level `isSidechain` (subagent turns; always billed 5m TTL).
 *   c5 / c1  — `usage.cache_creation.ephemeral_{5m,1h}_input_tokens`.
 *              Fallback when `cache_creation` is absent or its 5m field is
 *              null: flat `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` -> c5, c1 = 0.
 *   read     — `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`.
 *   compactBoundaryBefore — true when a `type:"system", subtype:"compact_boundary"`
 *              (or `isCompactSummary`) line immediately precedes this turn in the
 *              same session file. Used to exclude compaction rewrites from the
 *              recoverable leak bucket. Does NOT affect oracle-parity buckets.
